# Web Traffic Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting sustained high web traffic for specific web pages using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, feature extraction with TF-IDF and Word2Vec, and the utilization of models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest Classifier, SVM, and K-Nearest Neighbors classifier.

## Methodology
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and preprocess data for model suitability.
- **Feature Extraction:** Utilize TF-IDF and Word2Vec techniques for feature generation from textual data.
- **Model Implementation:** Employ various models for prediction.

## Instructions
### Setup
- Ensure necessary libraries (`scikit-learn`, `NLTK`, etc.) are installed.
- Download the dataset and place it in the designated folder.

### Execution
- Run provided scripts/notebooks for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model implementation.

### Evaluation
- Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.


## Conclusion
This project aims to predict sustained high web traffic for specific web pages using machine learning. Experiment with different models and parameters for optimal predictions.
